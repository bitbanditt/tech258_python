# Tuples

# Tuples are IMMUTABLE (cannot be changed).
# Things that can change or variable are called MUTABLE
# Lets people looking at code know a constant has been declared, and it won't change

essentials = ("bread", "eggs", "milk")
print(type(essentials))

# essentials[0] = "beans"
# Won't work as tuples are immutable
