# Scripting

### What is scripting?

Scripting is a way of giving commands to your computer telling it what to do and when.

### Scripting vs Programming

It is easy to be confused as to the difference between scripting and programming, but they are different.

* Programming is the creation of a new software. 
* Scripting however is the modificaton, automisation or customisation 
of an existing system or software.

# Standard python packages

There are some package/libraries that come standard with python. I shall name a few.
* math 
```` import math math.cos(math.pi / 4) ```` 
* random
```` import random random.choice([apple, peach, mango])````
* datetime 
```` from datetime import date now = date.today()````
* os 
```` import os
