# JSON

## What is it?

JS - JavaScript <br>
O - Object <br>
N - Notation 

JSON is a syntax for exchanging data between a browser/client and server.

It is really popular because it is considered system agnostic. It doesn't really matte what the two systems are written in. They can both exchange JSON.

## JSON syntax

Data is in name/value pairs

```
"Name":"Value"
```

Curly braces hold objects:

```
{"Name":"Value"}
```

Data can be separated by commas:

```
{"Name1":"Value1", "Name2": "Value2"}
```

Square brackets can be used for arrays (lists of data):

```
{"Name": ["Value1", "Value2"]}
```
