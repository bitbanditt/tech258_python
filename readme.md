# Tech 258 Python overview

### What is Python?

Python is a popular progamming language. It is high-level and general purpose.

### History of Python

Python was invented by Guido van Rossum in the Netherlands, somewhere in the late 1980s. It began being used in December 1989 and was a successor to 
the ABC programming language. Capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.

### Why is Python popular? Especially among DevOps engineers

- It has a simple syntax in comparison to other coding languages.
- It has a wide range of uses, from machine learning to data analysis.
- It works well with DevOps Tools Devops engineers often use.
- It has a vast amount of libraries useful to assist in scripting, which is heavily used by DevOps engineers.
- It is great for automation, which is again heavily used by DevOps engineers.

### What is a virtual environment (venv)?

A venv is a lightweight python installation separate from other python instances. It contains all the dependencies needed
to run Python.It also allows one to independently work on a pyhton project/file without affecting others you may have open.

### What is pip?

Pip or pip installer is the package manager for python. It allows for installation of packages/modules, libraries or 
applications that are not included in python as standard.

### What is scripting? how does it differ from programming?

Scripting is giving a set of commands to be executed at a specific time, generally with a specific function in mind.
A programme however is much wider in scope. It usually is created to fulfill a number of needs, functions and use cases.

### What are the base/inbuilt Python libraries?

The inbuilt python libraries are:
* NumPy (for working with numerical calculations and arrays)
* pandas (for data analysis)
* os (for interacting with the operating system from within python)
* datetime (for working with dates and times)
* statsmodels (for working with larger scale statistics and statistical models)
* scikit-learn (for machine learning)

### What are some of the most popular external libraries?

- Requests (for easy web communication)
- FastAPI (for API development)
- Tinkr (for creating GUI apps)
- Selenium (for automating web browser interaction)
